# U-Net Repository

This repository contains the implementation of the U-Net architecture, a popular convolutional neural network (CNN) used for semantic segmentation tasks in deep learning. The U-Net was introduced by Olaf Ronneberger et al. in their paper "U-Net: Convolutional Networks for Biomedical Image Segmentation" and has since been widely adopted due to its effectiveness in handling images with complex structures.

## Installation

To install the dependencies required to run the U-Net model, clone this repository and navigate to the project directory. Then, execute the following command:

bash pip install -r requirements.txt


Make sure you have Python installed on your system, along with pip, which is the package installer for Python.

## Usage

After installation, you can train the U-Net model using your dataset. To do so, prepare your data in the required format and update the configuration files accordingly. Then, navigate to `src/train.ipynb` and run the Jupyter Notebook script.
